# Eatr
As one of our team members is diabetic, it was a pain to manually log food in his diabetes monitor app while it was already being entered in another food tracking app, MyFitness pal. Wouldn't it be great it the two apps were in sync?

Eatr is our addition to the [MyFitnesspal python API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal) API, and the [diabetes app Nightscout](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor) by enabling MyFitnesspal foods to be logged into Nightscout as well.

For reference, MyFitnesspal is a food logger app. Nightscout is a web client for viewing blood sugar, as well as an iPhone app.
